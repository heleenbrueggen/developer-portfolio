The title of the thesis is Multilevel Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations through Bayesian Additive Regression Trees and is supervised by Thom Volker, Hanne Oberman and Gerko Vink from Utrecht University. It is expected to be finished in May 2024.\nFor now, you can find the research report for this thesis project and associated LateX file here.\n\n\nReproducible Research Project\nFor the course Markup languages and Reproducible Research Heleen created a reproducible research project. You can download a local copy of the repository here. This Github repository contains the file that is fully reproducible when running the script and is licensed.\n\n\nR-package\nAgain, for the course Markup languages and Reproducible Research Heleen created simple R-package which is availabele on Github. The package is called datageneration and can be installed using the following code: devtools::install_github(\"heleenbrueggen/datageneration\")\nThe package includes versioning, a license, tests, and a reference with DOI that can be found in the Github repository.\nThe package generates a simple data set containing normally distributed variables with a specified mean and standard deviation. From those variables a dependent variables y is created assuming a linear relationship between the variables. The user can specify the number of variables, the mean and standard deviation of the variables, and the amount of observations."

She is currently working on her Master thesis on the topic of implementing Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) models in multilevel multiple imputation though chained equations.\nNext to her universty studies, Heleen also currently studies classical violin with Carla Leurs at the conservatory of Utrecht at the Hogeschool voor de Kunsten Utrecht (HKU). She is currently in her third year of her Bachelor of Music degree and will graduate next year.\nIn her free time, Heleen enjoys sight-reading chamber music, drawing, reading, gaming and photography."
